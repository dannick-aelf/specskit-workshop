    // Slide 19: FAQ
    faq: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    faqDescription: 'Common questions from learners:',
    faqQ1: 'What if I make a mistake in my specification?',
    faqA1: 'No problem! You can always update your specification. Just edit the spec.md file or run /speckit.specify again with corrections. SpecKit is designed to be flexible—you can refine as you learn more.',
    faqQ2: 'Do I need to understand code to use SpecKit?',
    faqA2: 'Not at all! SpecKit is designed for non-technical team members. You write in plain English, and SpecKit handles the technical details. Just describe what you want, not how to build it.',
    faqQ3: 'What if the AI doesn\'t understand my prompt?',
    faqA3: 'Be more specific! Instead of \'add a button,\' try \'add a blue submit button at the bottom of the contact form that says Send Message.\' The more details you provide, the better the results.',
    faqQ4: 'Can I skip steps in the workflow?',
    faqA4: 'It\'s not recommended. Each step builds on the previous one. However, for very simple features, you might combine some steps. Start with the full workflow to learn it properly.',
    faqQ5: 'How long does each step take?',
    faqA5: 'Constitution: 5-10 minutes. Specify: 10-20 minutes. Plan: 5-10 minutes (automatic). Tasks: 2-5 minutes (automatic). Implement: Varies based on feature size. The time investment upfront saves hours of rework later.',
    faqQ6: 'What if I don\'t know what to write in my specification?',
    faqA6: 'Start simple! Describe the problem you\'re solving, who it\'s for, and what they should be able to do. For example: \'New employees need a way to submit their onboarding documents online so HR can track completion.\'',
